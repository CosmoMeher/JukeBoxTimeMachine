 <h1>Lyrics</h1>
 <h3>Music! Music! Music!</h3>
 <p>Put another nickel in, in the nickelodeon.</p>
 <p>All I want is loving you and Music! Music! Music!</p>
 <p>I’ll do anything for you; anything you’d want me to.</p>
 <p> All I want is kissing you and Music! Music! Music!</p>
  
 <p> Closer, my dear come closer.</p>
  
 <p>The nicest part of any melody is when you’re dancing close to me.</p>
  
 <p>  So put another nickel in, in the nickelodeon.</p>
 <p>All I want is loving you and Music! Music! Music!</p>
 <p>Put another nickel in, in the nickelodeon.</p>
 <p>All I want is Music! Music! Music!</p>
 <p>Closer, my dear come closer.</p>
  
 <p>The nicest part of any melody is when you’re dancing close to me.</p>
  
 <p>So put another nickel in, in the nickelodeon.</p>
 <p>  All I want is loving you, ah ah.</p>
  <p>All I want is loving you and Music! Music!</p>
  <p> Put another nickel in the nickelodeon. Music!</p>

  <p>She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
  <p> She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
    
  <p>You think you’ve lost your love? Well I saw her yesterday.</p>
  <p>It’s you she’s thinking of, and she told me what to say:</p>
  <p> She says she loves you, and you know that can’t be bad.</p>
  <p>Yes, she loves you, and you know you should be glad! Oo____</p>
  <p>She said you hurt her so, she almost lost her mind.</p>
  <p> But now she says she knows you’re not the hurting kind.</p>
  <p>She says she loves you, and you know that can’t be bad.</p>
  <p> Yes, she loves you, and you know you should be glad! Oo____</p>

  <p>And with a love like that, you know you should be gla(h)ad!</p>
  <p> You know it’s up to you, I think it’s only fair.</p>
  <p> Pride can hurt you too. Apologize to her.</p>
  <p>Because she loves you, and you know that can’t be bad.</p>
  <p>Yes, she loves you, and you know you should be glad! Oo____</p>
    
  <p>She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>

  <h2>Splish Splash</h2>
  <p>Splish, splash, I was takin a bath, ‘long about a Saturday night</p>
  <p> Rub, dub, just relaxin’ in the tub, thinkin’ ev’rything was alright.</p>
  <p> Well, I stepped out the tub, put my feet on the floor,</p>
  <p> Wrapped the towel around me and I opened the door.</p>
  <p> And then a splish, splash, I jumped back in the tub.</p>
  <p>Well how was I to know there was a party goin’ on.</p>
  <p> I was splishin’ and a-splashin’, rollin; and a-strollin’</p>
  <p>  Moovin’ and a-groovin’, reelin’ with the feelin’</p>
  <p>Splishin’ and a-splashin, rollin’ and a-strollin’,</p>
    
  <p> On a Saturday night.</p>
  <p> Bing, bang, I saw the whole gang.</p>
  <p>We were dancin’ on the living room rug.</p>
  <p> Flip, flop, we were doin’ the bop.</p>
  <p> And they all had their dancing shoes on</p>
  <p>There was Lollipop with Peggy Sue.</p>
  <p> Good golly, Miss Molly was even there too.</p>
  <p> Well, a-splish, splash, I forgot about the bath.</p>
  <p> I went and got my dancin’ shoes on.</p>
  <p> I was splishin’ and a-splashin’, rollin; and a-strollin’</p>
  <p> Moovin’ and a-groovin’, reelin’ with the feelin’</p>
  <p>Splishin’ and a-splashin, rollin’ and a-strollin’,</p>
  <p>  I saw Miss Molly Rockin’, she was dancin’ on the ceilin’</p>

      <h2>Breakaway</h2>
      <p>Da da da dn da da, da da da dn da da, da da da dn da da da da. (X2)</p>
      <p> Grew up in a small town, and when the rain would fall down I’d just stare out my</p>
        
      <p>window.</p>
        
      <p> Dreamin’ what I could be, and if I’d end up happy. I would pray.</p>
        
      <p> Trying hard to reach out, but when I tried to speak out felt like no one could hear</p>
        
      <p> me.</p>
        
      <p> Wanted to belong here, but something felt so wrong here.</p>
        
      <p>So I’d pray I could breakaway.</p>
      <p>I’ll spread my wings and I’ll learn how to fly.</p>
      <p> I’ll do what it takes till I touch the sky.</p>
        
      <p>I’ll make a wish, take a chance, make a change, and breakaway.</p>
        
      <p>Out of the darkness and into the sun.</p>
      <p> I won’t forget all the ones that I love.</p>
        
      <p> I’ll take a risk, take a chance, make a change, and breakaway.</p>
      <p> Da da da dn da da, da da da dn da da, da da da dn da da da da.</p>
        
      <p> Wanna feel the warm breeze, sleep under a palm tree, feel the rush of the ocean.</p>
      <p>Get on board a fast train, travel on a jet plane, far away. And breakaway.</p>
        
      <p> I’ll spread my wings and I’ll learn how to fly.</p>
      <p> I’ll do what it takes till I touch the sky.</p>
        
      <p> I’ll make a wish, take a chance, make a change, and breakaway.</p>
        
      <p>Out of the darkness and into the sun.</p>
      <p> I won’t forget all the ones that I love.</p>
        
      <p> I’ll take a risk, take a chance, make change, and breakaway.</p>
        
      <p> Breakaway. Breakaway.</p>
